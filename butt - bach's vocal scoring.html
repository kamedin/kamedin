<h1>Bach's vocal scoring: what can it mean?</h1>
<h2>John Butt</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Early Music</i>, Volume XXVI, Issue 1, 1 February 1998, Pages 99-108.</p>

<p>The public debate over Bach's chorus began in print in 1982. The primary actors were Joshua Rifkin, arguing that Bach seems to have performed the majority of his choral works with one singer to a part, and Robert Marshall, arguing that Bach's letter to the Leipzig town council in 1730 (Entwurff) states unequivocally that Bach desired –and probably got– three or four singers per part.<a id="1a" href="#1">1</a> Marshall was joined by many other voices during the later 1980s, all producing circumstantial evidence for larger performing forces. I have tried to show that a variety of choral scorings were feasible in Bach's time, including both single and multiple voices to a part, and I have also suggested that no scholar has really managed to challenge Rifkin on the specific territory of his argument, the format and interrelationship of the original performing parts.<a id="2a" href="#2">2</a> Moreover, Ulrich Siegele's extensive study of the political situation of Leipzig in Bach's time suggests that Bach wrote the Entwurff as part of an ongoing campaign (supported by one faction of the town council) to redefine his post as that of a professional Kapellmeister rather than as a Kantor-schoolmaster. The document may partly be a justification of Bach's recent appropriation of the Leipzig collegium musicum and is also greatly concerned with establishing a stronger bias towards music in the school's admissions policy.<a id="3a" href="#3">3</a> In short, it is clear that the document should not be read at face value as an unequivocal expression of Bach's established performance practice.</p>

<p>The dispute has flared up afresh in the pages of Early music. The ground has shifted little since the debate began over 15 years ago: Rifkin, now ably joined by Andrew Parrott, argues primarily from the evidence of the manuscript sources, while Ton Koopman, a 'choralist' fiercely justifying his ongoing 'historically correct' recording of the Bach cantatas, brings up the usual objections to the Rifkin hypothesis: the evidence of the Entwurff takes primary position, bolstered by other external evidence for larger choirs, speculations regarding the loss of parts, performance from memory, unnotated conventions of performance and many other nuggets of 'common sense'. I am loath to enter full-fronted into the dispute again: tempers are very high and the risk of repeating oneself or recapitulating a previous stage in the debate is almost unavoidable. So, I'd like to approach the issue from several different angles, examining first the role of scholars and performers today, the ideologies that may underpin the heat of the dispute and, finally, some questions that have not been asked regarding the Rifkin hypothesis: how does the indisputable fact that the 'soloist' in each part sang most, if not all, of the music within his range affect the meaning, or rather, the potential for meaning in the sacred vocal music of Bach? (Here I shall concentrate on the two Passions.) How does the performance both present and interpret what is often a complex of textual strands and religious traditions? It seems to me that the quest for an 'original performance practice' is curiously barren if separated from the original function of the music, indeed from the notion of an 'original audience'.</p>

<p>Andrew Parrott despairingly challenges the scholarly community to show more sense of responsibility by breaking its silence over this issue, noting 'the continuing failure of the professional musical world (performers, promoters, critics and especially musicologists) to engage with –let alone come to terms with– a vital and fascinating area of study... The extraordinary prevalence of such apathy prompts the uncomfortable question: who cares?'<a id="4a" href="#4">4</a> He also assumes that virtually no established scholars accept Rifkin's findings.<a id="5a" href="#5">5</a> While this is a fair assessment of the published literature, I have, in fact, observed a considerable shift in favour of Rifkin's position among the younger scholars within the community of American Bach scholars over the last few years, and even some of the more vociferous opponents have become remarkably more muted in their criticism.<a id="6a" href="#6">6</a> There are even rumours of Bach scholars in Germany paying more attention to Rifkin's theory. If I am correct in this hunch, the reason for this change may not be merely that more scholars are examining the Bach sources in greater detail and following through Rifkin's reasoning with the manuscripts to hand; it may well be that there is a fundamental change in the attitude towards historically informed performance and its relation to scholarship.<a id="7a" href="#7">7</a></p>

<p>To simplify the issue somewhat crudely, in the early 1980s most historically informed performers took what evidence they could from the sources and followed it, more or less literally. Scholars, to the extent that they were involved with issues of performance, were to provide empirical evidence, to be discussed and sifted through, and, if found to be sound, to be adopted by the performer. Today these relationships and roles seem considerably more complex; some scholars and performers tend to take a more critical stance towards whatever evidence emerges: did a composer get exactly what he desired? Did he tolerate what he got? Did he have only a single intention for performance? Are we to accept his intentions –presuming we know them– at face value? Are there factors other than the composer's desires that should be taken into account?</p>

<p>In short, I believe it is now possible to adhere to a general notion of historically informed performance, to acknowledge the likelihood of a theory such as Rifkin's, yet still not always feel compelled to follow it in practice. For instance, there are many things about singing style in Bach's environment that we do not –indeed cannot– know. Furthermore, the 'instruments' do not necessarily exist, in the sense that there are no trained males in their late teens with unbroken voices. We can only guess at whatever conceptions of text and music these singers held, how close they came to the trained operatic singers of the age. One-to-a-part performances today may tell us much about Bach's choral music but they might not come any nearer to the actual sound of Bach's performances. And, given the sort of professional singers available today, many are unsuitable for this kind of activity and some who are able to accept the work do so only grudgingly. In other words, to perform Bach's choral works with a small vocal group –as does Ton Koopman– certainly does not contravene typical practices of Bach's day, and, being part of our existing culture, it carries with it a spark of 'authenticity' (in the sense of immediacy, familiarity and performer identity; and, one might add, the conductor's belief that he is right!) that would parallel that of the original performers. Thus, the correct scoring with the wrong sound, attitude and a sense of alienation is hardly more correct than the wrong scoring together with a ready fluency and identification with an established practice. This is not to condemn the one-to-a-part performances of Rifkin and Parrott –most are excellent and extremely revealing– but to suggest that this method should hardly become a norm for the entire field of Bach performance without more familiarity with the practice and more available and willing performers. Parrott's recording of Bach's St John Passion shows an excellent and imaginative synthesis ('compromise' would sound too noncommittal) between historical practice and current traditions and practices. He adds single boy 'ripienists' (from the Tolzer Knabenchor) to the female 'concertists' in the soprano and alto parts of the choruses. The result may not necessarily approach the sound Bach heard, but it shows how historical considerations can be reinterpreted within the context of what is both possible and excellent within our own traditions and resources.</p>

<p>Before looking at the hermeneutic implications of Rifkin's conception of Bach's scoring I shall outline what I believe to be the most crucial factors of his argument. First, there is no way of establishing whether or not Bach's singers shared their individual parts purely on the basis of external evidence (unless an unambiguous account of their regular practice is discovered). As Parrott reminds us, the concertist parts in Bach's Passions contain most of the vocal material within their range (whether choir 1 or 2, in the St Matthew Passion); moreover the parts used by the Evangelist and Christ in both Passions are generally titled 'Evangelista' and Christus'.<a id="8a" href="#8">8</a> It is technically feasible that other singers could have looked on, and that one short rehearsal may have told them when to sing and when to be silent, but, given the performance detail of Bach's parts in general (e.g. indications of ornaments, dynamics and articulation) it seems surprising that the simple and far more basic indications of solo and tutti are generally absent. More likely Bach would have given separate parts to the extra singers doubling chorus lines, as is indeed the case for the St John Passion, one of the handful of pieces to survive with ripieno parts. Now, one obvious direction in which to argue is that such doubling was Bach's standard practice and countless ripieno parts may simply have disappeared.<a id="9a" href="#9">9</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to disprove this possibility but those who 'hope' for the discovery of these lost parts generally do so under the common-sense assumption that Bach, like most of us today, would have wanted to use any spare singers who happened to be around to bolster the choir for the chorales and choruses. Yet here Rifkin produces what for me was the coupe de grace: 'bit' parts in the Passions generally contain only their own particular roles, and surrounding choruses and chorales are usually marked 'tacet'.<a id="10a" href="#10">10</a> This phenomenon is evident in the St Matthew Passion part for Peter, Caiphas, Pontifex 2 and Pilate (all presumably taken by the one singer),<a id="11a" href="#11">11</a> and in the separate parts for the servant and Pilate in the St John Passion. Arthur Mendel, editor of the Neue Bach-Ausgabe volume of the St John Passion, notes that these tacet markings are eigentumlich ('peculiar') without commenting further.<a id="12a" href="#12">12</a> To explain away evidence such as this simply takes one too far beyond the bounds of reasonable historical scholarship: for instance, one could conjecture that the 'bit' parts were placed at too great a distance to participate with the other subsidiary singers in the choruses and chorales (and this must have been a very long way, to have disqualified them from the chorales); or perhaps they otherwise played instruments and needed the references to other movements, complete with 'tacet' markings, to orient themselves in relation to their instrumental parts.</p>

<p>My own examination of the autograph score of the St Matthew Passion reveals an interesting direction from Bach that may be the closest we have to verbal evidence of the one-to-a-part scoring. The duet with chorus, 'So ist mein Jesu nun gefangen' runs into the double chows 'Sind Blitze, sind Donner' and the latter begins on the last system (seven staves) of a verve page, which also contains the last two bars of 'So ist mein Jesu'. Given that these seven staves will not accommodate the two continuo lines, and the two bass and tenor lines that open the chorus (the ensuing page gives the standard double-choir format), the first two vocal entries and the continuo line are written on single staves (illus. 1). The opening bass entry is marked 'Basso 1 Chori/Basso 2 Chori [con]cord.', the next, tenor, entry has the marking 'due Tenori', while the continuo line is marked 'tutti li Bassi in unisono'. These markings seem entirely consistent with a chorus that had one singer to a part and a continuo section with (at least) a violoncello, violone and organ on each line; if 'tutti' is appropriate for indicating the amalgamation of two continuo lines (making a total of about six players) this would surely have been used to denote a choral line that likewise had about six singers to a part.</p>

<p>[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]</p>

<p>If it is accepted that a work like the St Matthew Passion was performed with single voices, this tells us something about the way the choral lines could be projected, perhaps with more soloistic flair than a choral scoring would normally imply. As I have suggested before, much of Bach's choral music could be considered to work more in the tradition of the Italian/German sacred concerto than in that of the German motet, for which multiple voices were more the norm.<a id="13a" href="#13">13</a> The concerto tradition, as most famously expounded for a German audience by Michael Praetorius, is fundamentally a soloistic genre to which doubling voices can sometimes be added, yet these ripienists never constitute a fundamental group in their own right. While Bach seems to have done without the doubling voices in the St Matthew Passion he did, in fact, use them in the St John. This difference is somewhat strange given that the choral lines of the latter are more virtuoso (and thus more soloistic?). However, the assumption that Bach probably wished to combine the resources of his first and second choirs is probably correct.<a id="14a" href="#14">14</a> Certainly the doubled scoring facilitates the performance of 'Mein teurer Heiland', in which the solo bass sings from the concertist bass part while the ripieno bass, singing from the ripieno part, provides the bass line to the chorale which is sung simultaneously. We can surmise that the two Passions seem to have had choirs of equal weight, although that of the St Matthew often splits into two. More significantly, these cases suggest that it was not absolutely crucial to Bach whether the choral lines were sung either one-to-a-part or more than one-to-a-part. The lesson for us is, rather, that these choral lines were essentially soloistically conceived, however many singers might actually have realized them (difficult as this may seem in the context of today's psychology of performance, when singers, at all levels, will insist on an essential difference between solo and doubled realization of choral lines).</p>

<p>The entire debate about vocal scoring brings up another issue, one which takes us outside of the usual discussions about the technicalities of performance. This arises when we consider Ton Koopman's remark about the bass part of 'Mein teurer Heiland' in the St John Passion. To him it seems patently absurd that the bass who has just 'died' as the figure of Christ should now, reading off the same part, sing the bass line of the aria. There must, he says, have been two concertists reading off the part, one singing Christ and the other the other solos.<a id="15a" href="#15">15</a> Yet if Bach went to the trouble to prepare four ripieno parts to be used separately from the concertist parts, and the parts of the servant and Pilate appear in dedicated parts (containing no other music), it would seem strange that he did not prepare two, differentiated, concertist bass parts (furthermore, it should be remembered, Bach's concertist bass parts for both Passions are marked 'Christus').</p>

<p>In short, the idea that the bass who sang the part of Christ sang nothing else is not substantiated by the sources and there is no reason to think that the Passions were designed like operas with clearly differentiated character roles. After all, the actual part of Peter in both Passions is extremely simple (presumably sung by an inexperienced singer?), while his weeping is elaborately depicted by the Evangelist and his personal sorrow rendered both intimate and universal in the ensuing arias ('Ach, mein Sinn', found in the Evangelist part of the St John Passion, 'Erbarme dich' in the concertist alto part of the St Matthew). If these works were operas, one would expect the sorrow and reflection to be confined to the one character, Peter. Handel's 'Brockes Passion', for instance, as a non-liturgical Passion-oratorio follows the operatic conventions of oratorio in which the minor roles are developed into substantial characters. Here Peter himself sings two remorseful arias after the cock-crow ('Heul, du Fluch!' and 'Schau, ich fall' in strenger Busse'), introducing and separating them with his own reflective recitatives.</p>

<p>Points such as these suggest that Bach's Passions –however operatic in style and affect– were never conceived along operatic lines. Indeed, they were never isolated musical works to be enjoyed outside their liturgical environment. Performed on either side of the sermon for Good Friday Vespers, they were vehicles of preaching rather than entertainment. They were designed not only to present the most important Gospel text of the year (thus taking the place of the Gospel reading) but also to be profoundly interpretative. In the Lutheran tradition any reading of the Bible was considered already an interpretation,<a id="16a" href="#16">16</a> and Bach and his librettists seem to have gone out of their way to embellish the story rhetorically, to drive home theological points and to guide the meditation of the congregation. Given that many performers and scholars are squeamish when it comes to the fundamentally religious function of Bach's church music, it is not surprising that they have sought refuge in examining literalistically the technical fundamentals of notation and performance practice. Furthermore, studies that take a hermeneutic approach to Bach's music and texts are often easy prey to scepticism, particularly if they show any signs at all of scholarly weakness on a factual level.<a id="17a" href="#17">17</a></p>

<p>However, it is clear that essential elements of Lutheran doctrine are articulated in Bach's Passion texts and, at the very least, the vocal scoring (as suggested by the format of the original parts) resonates with this approach. Luther stated at the outset of his Passion sermons of 1519 and 1521 that it is wrong to blame others –such as Judas and the Jews, collectively– for the death of Christ since, as sinners always already fallen, we are all to blame.<a id="18a" href="#18">18</a> This attitude might give us a clue as to why Bach gave the parts of Peter in both Passions (and Judas in the St Matthew) to singers who participate in none of the choruses, chorales or arias. Their parts become featureless –virtually anonymous– while the sorrow of their betrayals is vividly portrayed in the Evangelist's depiction of weeping and in the arias sung by the concertists. In other words, their failure is universalized, passed from one singer to another, to show that it is a matter for the general human condition and not the personal tragedy of an individual sinner.</p>

<p>As Eric Chafe has suggested, Bach may have structured the St John Passion –somewhat oddly regarding its temporal proportions– to balance the cowardice of Peter in the first half with Pilate's ultimate failure of faith in the second. In the St Matthew Passion our own responsibility for the suffering of Christ is heavily emphasized in the ariosos and arias of the first half (and reinforced in the second with 'Erbarme dich') and our imitation of Christ in accepting our own suffering (usefully occasioned by the character of Simon of Cyrene, the first human literally to follow Christ and bear his cross) becomes an important topic in the second half. This, together with an intermediate emphasis on Christ's loving redemption, follows more or less the structure of Luther's own meditation on the Passion.<a id="19a" href="#19">19</a> Luther, feeling keenly his own persecution, stressed that Christ's Passion should not be acted out in words or appearances but in one's own life;<a id="20a" href="#20">20</a> having acknowledged guilt and received Christ's loving redemption, all should foster their potential to imitate Christ and be fearless in the face of persecution.</p>

<p>In all, it seems that Bach and his librettists went out of their way to show how we could all become virtually any character in the Passion story, that human works often end in failure, that we are not predestined to be damned or saved, but that contrition, faith in Christ's love and the imitation of Christ are the way forward. The multiple roles of the chorus are well known; indeed, this was a tradition in musical settings of the Passion before Bach: the same group of people thus has the potential to be good, bad or indifferent. However, what is usually missed in performances today is the multiple role-playing on the part of the singer who sang the Evangelist, and –most importantly– Christ.</p>

<p>First, the singer of Christ in both Passions also has to be part of the crowd, regardless of its mood (these roles being in the New Testament time zone). Furthermore, he sings in the Lutheran time zone of the chorale, and, finally, in the Leipzig present of the arias. His participation in the choruses (as the concertist bass in the St John Passion and as the sole bass in choir 1 in the St Matthew) is very striking as he has constantly to switch between the role of Christ and that of a crowd that frequently calls for 'his' own death. This helps to reinforce the typically Lutheran point that we are all to be held responsible for Christ's death, however Christ-like any of us may seem.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the two bass arias in the St John Passion, and those for bass 1 (i.e. in the part labelled 'Christus') in the St Matthew Passion come towards the end of the work when Christ is largely silent or already dead.<a id="21a" href="#21">21</a> We now hear a singer who is sonically associated with Christ as a human being trying to follow and imitate Christ, a remarkably potent and poignant move. In the aria 'Eilt, ihr angefochten Seelen' from the St John Passion Bach adapts a text from B. H. Brockes: 'Der fur die Sunde der Welt gemartete und sterbende Jesus'. Here the singer exhorts the other three vocal parts to follow him to Golgotha. ('Hasten, you beleaguered souls, Whither?... Fly! Whither? To the mount of the cross, Your welfare cloth flourish there!') There is a sense that the bass, as an imitator of Christ, is already at Golgotha and consequently knows more about the salvation that can be achieved by following Christ. Brockes wrote the original text for the allegorical character, the 'daughter of Zion', thus suggesting the use of a high, female voice (as Handel does in his setting). Given the popularity of Brockes' text, Bach undoubtedly knew of it in its original form (indeed, he probably made the selections from it himself) and must have had conscious reasons for reassigning it to bass.</p>

<p>As Ton Koopman has noted, the bass aria with chorale, 'Mein teurer Heiland', comes at precisely the moment after Jesus dies, but the notion that it is sung by the same singer who performed the part of Christ is not necessarily absurd. First, one of the central points of St John's Gospel is the view of Christ as divine from the start and that his resurrection and victory are all preordained, the mechanical means by which we achieve salvation. In this aria, the singer who has just played the part of Christ now speaks as a human who asks if the process of salvation has indeed been achieved through Christ's death. With the line 'Es is vollbracht, bin ich vom Sterben freigemacht?' ('It is fulfilled, am I freed from death?'), the sense of the singer's salvation is particularly strong; having just 'died' he now has the means towards eternal life, he is 'freed from death' both as a human being and as Christ himself. Moreover, the accompanying chorale begins with the lines 'Jesu, der du warest tot, lebest nun ohn Ende' ('Jesu, you who were dead now live without end') addressed by the entire chorus of singers to the very singer who took the part of Christ. At the very moment of his death, his resurrection and immortality are thus assured.</p>

<p>In the St Matthew Passion we see Christ as more of a vulnerable human being; his eternal divinity is not so obvious as in St John's Gospel (in the synoptic Gospels, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Christ's divinity is revealed more according to a temporal 'timetable' with its climax at the resurrection). Picander, Bach's librettist, places a great emphasis on Christ's supreme love and the very human aspect of his suffering. This may reflect the influence of the early-enlightenment move away from Christ as the instrument who satisfies the wrath of an angry God towards a focus on the relation between a loving Christ and the human being, the conception of Christ as an ideal model of humanity.<a id="22a" href="#22">22</a> Imitation of Christ is the central theme of the first bass 1 aria from the St Matthew Passion, 'Komm, susses Kreuz' ('Come, sweet cross, I will say, my Jesus, just put it on me! Should my pain become too heavy, then help me to carry it Yourself'). This comes after the bass recitative accompagnato 'Ja freilich will in uns' ('Yes, gladly is the flesh and blood in us compelled to the cross; the more it benefits our souls, the more painfully it weighs.'). This pair of solos comes at the point at which Simon of Cyrene helps Christ bear the cross. Simon is, literally, the first human to carry Christ's burden, who –more than anyone– teaches us by example that if we imitate Christ he will reciprocally help us in our travail. Thus the bass concertist makes his first appearance as a soloist in the Leipzig present at precisely the point at which a human being begins to imitate Christ. The fact that he has been imitating Christ for the entire Passion up to this juncture renders the point extremely strongly the imitator of Christ in Leipzig takes strength from the first imitator of Christ in Jerusalem, and is thus heard by the congregation as a sort of Simon of Cyrene character.</p>

<p>The second bass 1 recitative-aria is the last such pair in the piece ('Am Abend, da es kuhle war'/'Mache dich, mein Herze, rein') and will thus make a particularly lasting impression on the listener. The arioso makes reference to the fact that Jesus has endured the cross, his body is at rest; the last lines run 'Bid them give me the dead Jesus. O healing, O precious keepsake.' The aria goes on to plead more for this 'keepsake', with the words 'I will myself entomb Jesus. For He shall henceforth in me take His sweet rest for ever and ever'. The rhetorical force of someone singing about henceforth containing Christ, when he has just indeed been acting through the last moments of his saviour's life, is undoubtedly very strong. Our overworked singer provides us with a model of faith which further encourages us to take on Christ as a model of human perfection.</p>

<p>If Bach's Passions differ from opera in their blurring of the distinctions between different personalities within the dramatization they also create a very different 'implied listener'. The implied listener of late Baroque opera is likely to be a fairly stable figure sitting outside the action, excited, moved and calmed by what goes on but at a consistent distance in space and time. Operas are usually written with a fixed point of view in mind, somewhat akin to the perspective in painting, a point from which the constant alternations between real and emotional time (i.e. recitative and aria) are effortlessly assimilated. In Bach's Passions, on the other hand, the constant changes of time zone and the fluidity of subjecthood would render the works baffling from an operatic standpoint. There is no longer a stable, objective implied listener as the action shuttles between real New Testament and an emotional present. While an operatic aria might address the listener in the abstract (e.g. about the value of hope or the destructiveness of jealousy) much of the poetic material in the Passions –derived as it is directly from sermon poetry– speaks directly to the individual listener. Moreover, this listener is enjoined to witness the drama silently, to be shocked, to experience remorse and to undergo personal (as opposed to sympathetic) emotional change. Just as the singers do, the listener undergoes constant fluctuations of subjectivity: at one moment a passive observer, powerless to intervene in the grim, relentless action, he or she is next part of a group within a tradition of worship and then an individual sinner who learns of salvation.</p>

<p>This short study suggests something of the way Bach's scoring of the Passions may have been designed to reinforce certain aspects of the Lutheran faith and create extra shades of meaning in the text and music. It may well be that these aspects of the scoring were more important to Bach than the difference of sound between one, two or three singers on a part. Whatever the truth of my conjectures, they should at least suggest that even if we get exactly the same balance of forces that Bach attained or desired, the music will have little of the intended effect in the context of the largely agnostic world of historical performance. Only in the late 20th century has it been regularly assumed that historical fidelity of sound somehow carries with it the fidelity of historical experience; this position is becoming increasingly difficult to uphold.</p>

<p><a id="21" href="#21a">21</a> There is a bass arioso at an earlier point in the St John Passion (in all but the 1725 version), 'Betrachte, meine Seel", which comes near the beginning of part 2. However, contrary to the pattern Bach later established in the St Matthew Passion, the ensuing aria is sung not by the bass but by the tenor.</p>
